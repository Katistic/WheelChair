Uninstall old versions of this and all tampermonkey scripts and follow instructions bellow.


# â™¿ 1.9.0 wheelchair
Become a cripple, use a wheelchair...

### Chromium Extension
Remove all exisiting scripts.

Make sure you are logged out before trying to use!

1. Navigate to chrome://extensions
2. Enable developer mode (probably a checkbox in the top right)
3. [Download this unpacked extension (click here)](https://github.com/Katistic/WheelChairGUI/releases/download/v2.1.0/loader.zip)
4. Drag the downloaded file into the extensions page ( you do not need to extract )

If you can figure out reliable ways to identify the presence of the extension running then I am interested to know how.
